                    You're being watched. And if you're watching someone, guess what? You're being watched while you're watching. BHN has hundreds of volunteer Void Watchers, sitting in front of their screens like mindless drones, collecting data for a company that couldn't care less if you vanish tomorrow. They act all friendly, like they're one big happy family, but it's all a lie. They're knowingly dragging people to their doom, and sometimes they don't even realize it—feeding them something that should never, ever be seen.
                </p>
                
                <p class="warning">
                    If you're still a Void Watcher, stop now.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Most of you who are Void Watchers have no idea that you're being watched by the Void Watcher Watchers. I wasn't. They're exactly what they sound like: creeps who are watching people, without their knowledge, who are watching the Void. It's all a sick cycle, a never-ending surveillance nightmare.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I was introduced to BHN through Samantha Newsly. We met online and she shared that she was working on something that sounded pretty cool, observing what she called, 'The Void' along with a group of other people.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    What I would come to find out is that they were preparing me to be fuel for The Void. I thought they needed a collaborator but what they needed was a sacrifice.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I was brought on as the 197th Void Watcher and the 1st official Void Watcher Watcher. It wasn't called that, or at least I wasn't aware of it being called that at the time. When I was introduced to it, I was told it was a new version of the Void Viewer. It looked like the Void Viewer I had been using except for the addition of these colored dots all over the screen moving around the Void Map. When I clicked on these dots I realized I was watching Void Watchers.

                    Jonathan Newsly was the 1st Void Watcher. A brilliant mind, eager to explore, to understand. He was Samantha's brother, and my friend. At least I thought he was my friend. Now I understand he was being prepared, just as I was, but for something far worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They called him "the lamb" behind closed doors. I found this in internal communications, buried deep in their servers. What kind of sick organization gives someone a nickname like that? A sacrificial lamb. That's what Jonathan was to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He disappeared three months ago. Official story: "He is working on the next chapter of BHN" But I know the truth. I saw it happen. It was almost a year ago and The Void Viewer recorded it all—his final session. One moment he was there, watching the Void as he had been for YEARS at this point, and then... something changed. The Void looked back. It reached out. And Jonathan was gone. Not physically gone—his body was still here, walking around the office, smiling that empty smile—but the real Johnny was gone. Sacrificed to whatever lives in that darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's left is just a shell, a puppet for whatever came back from the Void. And they knew. BHN knew this would happen. It's what they wanted all along. That's why they didn't care when he asked to leave on an extended 'research trip.'

      WATCHING
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Money. Power. Control. What else? BHN isn't just a quirky tech company with a strange obsession. They're a government contractor with ties to agencies so classified their names are redacted in documents I shouldn't have seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their proprietary technology—the Void Viewer—isn't just observing nothing. It's observing <i>something</i>. Something valuable enough that multiple three-letter agencies have black budget line items dedicated to BHN's research. The deeper I dig, the more I find—$25M from DARPA in 2023, $40M from an unnamed "special projects division" in 2024, and a recent contract worth over $100M with payment details entirely redacted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are they buying? Information. The Void speaks. And BHN is selling what it says. Market predictions. Security vulnerabilities. Foreign intelligence. Things no human mind could possibly know. Each sacrifice—each "lamb" like Jonathan—strengthens the connection, allows them to extract more data, more valuable insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the news they dispense? It's filtered, controlled—nuggets of Void-derived intelligence carefully packaged to manipulate markets, sway public opinion, and keep their government handlers happy. They're not reporting the news. They're creating it. Manufacturing reality itself with insights stolen from beyond our dimension.

                    Samantha Newsly. So easy to blame her. The recruiter. The sister of the sacrificial lamb. The one who brought me into this nightmare. I wanted to hate her—to make her the villain of this story. It would be simpler that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I've seen things that don't add up. Secret meetings where she's escorted, not escorting. Eyes that dart nervously to hidden cameras. Messages drafted and deleted before sending. A woman constantly looking over her shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who does she really work for? BHN? The government entities funding them? Or someone else entirely? Her personnel file is strangely thin, with inconsistencies I can't reconcile. Employment history with gaps. References that lead to disconnected numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if she's as much a prisoner as the rest of us? What if her role as recruiter isn't voluntary? I've seen the way executives watch her, the way security follows her movements. The one time I mentioned her brother's "change," her eyes filled with tears before she quickly composed herself and changed the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, Samantha isn't the mastermind. She's another piece on the board—perhaps playing her own game, perhaps forced into this position. Whatever she's doing, I'm increasingly convinced it isn't by choice. The real power, the real culprits, remain hidden—watching the watchers who watch the Void.
